{'Author': 'Joshua Loo', 'Date': '15.1.18', 'Category': 'Editorial', 'Tags': ('The Elizabethan',), "Issue": "Supplementary Issue 3"}

The New Year has prompted a little æsthetic reflexion, culminating in
the various changes present in this supplementary. It is desired that
this issue should represent an improvement on the previous editions not
only æsthetically but also in legibility, clarity and economy—of ink,
paper and so on.

It behoves me (as editor) to thank those who have supported us in our
experiment to this point: the members of the Library Committee, who have
been a constant support, the ever-present librarians—Mrs. Goetzee, Ms.
Stone, Ms Stringer and M^me^ Dessouroux—who have caught many typos and
other stylistic problems, our perennial scientific-cum-mathematic
authors—Benedict Randall Shaw and Isky Mathews—and other
contributors—James Bithell, Benedict Mee, Thomas Adamo and Luke Dunne to
name a few, the Chair of the Library Committee—Jonny Heywood—whose
drawings on the cover have prevented several delays, and our readers,
whose existence some authors were not entirely sure of initially, but
who have surprised us by their appearance and comments in the most
unlikely of places—in the Library Committee, when walking around, and
even in the lunch queue.

It may also be useful to elaborate further on the nature of this
experiment. *The Librarian* exists to publish ‘good’ articles, for a
certain value thereof; perhaps the best description of what we seek is
from Hacker News, an online forum administered by Y Combinator, a
startup incubator, who ask that submissions should ‘gratif\[y\] one’s
intellectual curiosity’[^1]. There is little further purpose. We do not
desire particularly for a large readership; we recognise that our aim is
not such that all will find our publication interesting, and are happy
to leave them to read those publications which they find more to their
taste; this is, after all, an experiment. Many have suggested that our
readership is excessively small. Those who are significantly involved in
*The Librarian* too often thought that there were few readers. We have
been greatly heartened by our discovery of multiple readers; we deduce
from the gradual disappearance of the copies of *The Librarian* that at
least twelve or so people must read this.

Nevertheless, we have been less heartened by the response to our appeals
for contributions; we are not so much disheartened by a lack of articles
or content —though we are not exactly inundated by proposals for long
form articles of the highest quality whose publication must
unfortunately be delayed—but by a lack of other cogent perspectives; all
but one of our polemics was written by the editor, all articles relating
to mathematics and the sciences were written either by Benedict Randall
Shaw or Isky Mathews, and the situation in our review section is only a
little better. There is no use in the pretence that those who have
written for *The Librarian* represent a diverse spectrum of anything,
really. Certainly, we do not represent a wide spectrum of life
experiences—which, however hard we may try, will inevitably occasionally
affect one’s writing, nor can it be said that we are intellectually,
politically or socially detached from each other. There may be fault on
our part—it has been suggested that *The Librarian* does not appear
accessible—but, equally, there is no remedy save an increase in the
submission of articles. The present surplus of scientific and mathematic
articles, though regrettable, is simply a product of the greater
advancement of the lack of articles in other areas.

The reader need not worry, of course, that this publication will fold;
there are enough of us to steer the ship into greener pastures, though
perhaps not enough to avoid Jim Hacker-like mixing of metaphors and
their analogues elsewhere. Those more prone to worries of civilisational
collapse or general qualitative collapse in the constitutions of the
present generation would not, however, be swayed from such views were
they to read some of the older editions of *The Elizabethan*, not so
much because they would find its content better—for the more serious
content has not disappeared but moved to other publications, viz.
*Camden* and *Hooke*—but that there seem to have existed a vast array of
pupil-run independent publications. That it happened that the population
of a house—in a time where the conveniences of modern technology were
scarcely known to the typewriter-employing creatures of the era—was able
to sustain an entire termly publication is astonishing. That there were
several mentioned, viz. the *Grantite Review*, *Ashtree*, *Rigaudite
Review* and *College Street Clarion*, and that there was, further, a
scientific publication, viz. *Nucleus*, a cultural publication, viz.
*Polygon*[^2] and yet *The Elizabethan* did not appear to suffer from
the want of articles later complained of by the 1970s[^3] could perhaps
most charitably be described as an indictment of the relative state of
the present pupil body.

One should not be surprised to find that our proposed remedy is writing
for *The Librarian* (and, indeed, all other school publications); the
present crop of publications is published very irregularly—*The
Librarian* seems to be the most frequent, but is rather short, and the
others are far too infrequent. The problem is not so much that there is
a lack of publications, so much as that they are too infrequently
published to make a major impression upon school life, and will only be
rectified if we should contrive to increase the frequency of their
publication.

Some readers may ask why one should wish for pupil publications[^4] at
all. To them, we say that a publication ensures that those who seek to
write are able to embarrass themselves before they reach the outside
world; it ameliorates the fluency and clarity with which those who
contribute and those who read think; it provides an historical record
for those who will in the future wonder how we write, think and spend
our time at present; it is, in short, a great contribution to the
denizens of the community whose time it disturbs or graces. We should
find no
