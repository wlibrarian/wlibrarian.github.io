<h1 id="on-common-institutions-and-dialectic-speech">On common institutions and dialectic speech</h1>

<p>The following note has been added for clarity.</p>
<p><strong>This article is not published in my capacity as the Editor of <em>The Librarian</em>, nor does it represent the views of the library or the Library Committee. It is published in my personal capacity. The headmaster has discussed this article with me and raised no objection to its publication or specific objection to its content. The title of this article has been changed so as to shift emphasis onto a consideration of the general, not special, case. It is published here for historical and archival purposes.</strong></p>
<p>When the headmaster fatuously attacked protectionism as a false God, he appeared to commit three sins. First, he exploited what ought to be a neutral platform, ie. that of the headmaster in a school assembly, for political ends. Second, there was no opportunity for reply, either in the form of similarly vacuous hand-wringing or actual consideration. Third, he failed to provide any analysis as to why his claims are true - a rather dubious method by which one might follow a “Gladstonian” liberal tradition which presumably ostensibly embraces substantive dialogue rather than empty rhetoric.</p>
<p>Yet as we explore how platforms in common institutions should be used, we come up against a number of barriers in coherently defining a way to exclude some but include others with a sufficiently nuanced and accurate brush; not only this, it is difficult to generalise such rules so that they apply from different ideological viewpoints.</p>
<p>Before that, we should note two recent pronouncements from the headmaster:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The headmaster attacked Trump and protectionism in Latin prayers last term, and has repeatedly promoted his idea of Gladstonian liberalism.</p></li>
<li><p>The headmaster claimed that the Armenian genocide was the first in the twentieth century.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="substance">Substance</h1>
<p>The point of speech which departs from that which has been established<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is presumably to convince us that there are more things which should be established; in turn, this relies on the assumption that we should like to find truth. Given this, reply is important. An initial argument is not necessarily correct; corrections are important. Even if the original thesis of an argument turns out to be correct, the process of rebuttal strengthens arguments - knowing the same truth for better reasons is itself desirable. Finally, reply, and further replies in turn, increase the perception that truth has been found. When a good process for finding the truth has been found, ie. argument, it is important that other people recognise its validity, the more to transmit truth.</p>
<p>Protectionism’s lack of efficacy has not been established in three ways. First, it is unclear which moral system is best used to determine what is good or bad. A “utilitarianism of money”, which blindly seeks the greatest gross global product, would differ in its recommendations to preference utilitarianism, Rawlsian justice as fairness in its original moral formulation, or rights theory. Second, even practising a Li-style<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> “informed neutrality between reasonable ethical positions”, it is not clear whether protectionism “works” - Ha-Joon Chang writes that protectionism in some forms was crucial to industrialisation in a number of countries<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, in a tradition of correlated protectionism and development stretching back at least to high American tariffs in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, South Korea’s rapid industrialisation and a number of other examples; this industrialisation and the concomitant reduction of human misery are presumably good things in all reasonable ethical positions. Third, at no point was it established as a founding truth for the school, nor was it acknowledged or assented to. We may, for example, implicitly agree not to be violent to each other, with all the constraints on the full implementation of certain ideologies this entails, in going to school; we do not agree to the headmaster’s Gladstonian liberalism in its full muscular “glory”. Hence in this sense, what the headmaster does not fall into the set of established ideas which are broadly acceptable.</p>
<p>What sort of principles should be applied to those who wish to depart from what has been established, in terms of their presentation?</p>
<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, they must act so as to maximise truth. There was little chance of anyone shouting in reply “no it isn’t” to the headmaster without sanction; this is obviously a relatively trivial barrier to remove. Replies must be available, and listened to by everyone who listens to the original; if attendance is compulsory, attendance to the reply must also be compulsory, so that reply actually works. They must also be given sufficient time, and due notice. Additionally, any form of sanction oughtn’t to exist. They may inevitably exist unless the headmaster is, for example, stripped of all power within the school, but need not unnecessarily exist. It mustn’t necessarily be the case that everyone is afforded the opportunity to speak. It is however, desirable that at the very least an opposing viewpoint is heard.</p>
<p>Second, and relatedly, these views mustn’t be presented as established. A headmaster appears to hold the full force of the coercive and administrative apparatus of the school. It must be expressly stated that whatever he says is not the view of the school if it is not established as such. This separation must be made clear so as to enable the full implementation of the first principle<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This was not done.</p>
<p>Third, these views must be important. There is limited time and limited space for discussion. Importance can be defined in a moral sense - the imparting of important moral truths, ie. what <em>ought</em>, can be said to be important, and we can measure importance in this way. Truths as to what <em>is</em> are also important<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, if they are important based on two kinds of ought. The first is when an ought is already established. The second is when the case that something ought to be the case is made in the same way, as described before.</p>
<p>The lack of desirability of the third sin is uncontroversial. Those who decry protectionism likely seek a better justification and presentation of this view than what occurred in Latin prayers. Those who support it would simply note the falsity of his claim. It is not particularly controversial to seek an amelioration in standards of discourse, though the headmaster is not alone in dialectic moronisation and is perhaps better than certain others in his ability to orally extemporise a series of grammatical English sentences, each with a main verb, unlike some of the present “friends” of one (now part-time) occupant of Chequers.</p>
<p>Hence we add another two principles. Fourth and relatedly, views must be rigourous and have a moderate chance of success, even if they do not fully convince. This is partly related to the third principle, ie. that of prioritisation, but it is also because poorly justified views are more likely to be incorrect than rigourously justified views, insofar as ordinarily that true views are more easily justified.</p>
<p>Fifth, nothing in these principles fails to apply to the assumptions, anecdotes, quotes and any other topics during all compulsorily attended discourse. An inadvertent denial of the Herero and Nama genocide in German-ruled Namibia by terming the Armenian genocide “first” in the twentieth century would be unacceptable even were it not to be a main message.</p>
<h1 id="neutrality-a-desideratum">Neutrality: a desideratum?</h1>
<p>The solution to the first sin, whether in Liberty University’s compulsion of students to listen to Ted Cruz<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> or Westminster’s to the Headmaster appears to be neutrality. Compulsory school meetings ought to simply be about school - fire drills, timetabling, achievements and other educational minutiae. This has a certain appeal - it seems to be functional (who gains from vacuous hand-wringing?), fair, and clear.</p>
<h2 id="is-compulsorily-attended-dialectic-discourse-helpful">Is compulsorily attended dialectic discourse helpful?</h2>
<p>Compulsory discourse which is overtly dialectic causes three harms.</p>
<p>First, it alienates those who disagree with the message it spreads. Although this may not seem like a harm in all circumstances, eg. if it alienates racists, the neutrality of institutions is itself a good in that it enables different otherwise mutually incompatible sections of society to cooperate. Consider, for example, rubbish collection: if rubbish collection is politicised (eg. if all rubbish bins were to be painted with anti-racist slogans), it is possible that those who disagree (even if they are wrong<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>) will stop cooperating with rubbish collection. This is bad because rubbish collection is environmentally important.</p>
<p>Second, it unfairly advantages certain points of view. Arguments cannot be agreed with if they aren’t heard. Where there is compulsory discourse, it is often delivered by an authority figure - a headmaster or a graduation speaker, to take a few examples. Listeners may view such discourse with undeserved respect. This is not to say that these figures cannot be correct, but rather that they are less likely to be correct than the people whom would be trusted by the force of their argument, unbuttressed by the perceived stature which many of these authority figures possess.</p>
<p>Third, it alienates those who do not wish to listen to dialectic reasoning. Compulsory attendance already is sufficiently coercive to cause resentment. This resentment is compounded by the addition of seemingly unneeded dialectic speech. Why must more of their time be wasted? They are not listening - they are worse than idling, for they who must listen unwillingly to headmasterly pronouncements on Gladstonian liberalism are not enjoying themselves. Even if a lack of interest is to be decried, one’s aim oughtn’t to be to maximise the misery of the uninterested but to increase their interest. This feeling of resentment is entirely unnecessary; it reduces the likelihood that individuals will naturally gravitate towards interest, which will produce a superior organic and sustainable interest.</p>
<p>This harm must be weighed against the benefit to, to continue this example, the people who feel supported by anti-racist slogans. The benefit is not only not particularly large, but also is not uniquely achieved by such an action. There are many other ways to promote anti-racism and make oppressed racial minorities feel happy. Where there are other avenues open which directly concern a matter<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, one oughtn’t to use institutions whose specific purpose would be negatively impacted.</p>
<p>If there are no such avenues, such action ought to be permissible only if it meets two conditions.</p>
<p>First, the harm to, for example, rubbish collection, must be minimised, in attempting to use the least destructive means possible, using the previous set of avenues to the maximum extent possible and so on. This ought to be fairly obvious.</p>
<p>Second, benefit must outweigh systemic and immediate harms to, to continue the example, rubbish collection. We must consider all the extra rubbish which will be incorrectly sorted, littered or thrown into rivers etc.; we must consider the harm to cooperation with other council services as well. Insofar as this is very difficult to quantify and predict, the second condition must be modified such that, out of an abundance of caution, the smallest reasonably likely set of benefits must be larger than the greatest reasonably likely set of harms to accrue. This is because systemic harm is very difficult to rectify. At worst, it looks like the tribal epistemics that are described by David Roberts<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, where institutions are abandoned wholesale to the point that having common institutions at all which help us to find the truth, like universities (whose research helps to improve society by telling us about problems and how to fix them), neutral government institutions (who have a similar function - not to deliberate about what ought to be the case but to implement ought-conditions given to them by governments and tell the public about what <em>is</em> so that they can figure out what ought to be) and, just as important if not more so, a free press, becomes increasingly unworkable due to a lack of public buy-in. Notably, there are few easy solutions once this road is gone down. It is unclear how, if at all, the mainstream press is to regain the trust of those who are convinced that it is now in the pay of globalist conspirators. All neutral institutions are potentially subject to the same level of abandonment, which greatly diminishes their utility. To err on the side of caution, therefore, is only a logical conclusion of this<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If the headmaster insists on using his platform for the propagation of dialectic material in the manner he has done so, it’s clear that he risks incurring systemic harm of the same sort.</p>
<p>First, those who agree with his statements may benefit. However, they will not particularly benefit - a headmaster’s consolation is not insubstantial but it is not clear that it is particularly large. Moreover they are capable of reading things they agree with in other places, at other times, by authors more reputable (since their livelihoods may be based on writing about the economics which the headmaster of a school is not <em>ex oficio</em> concerned with). Hence we can largely discount this benefit.</p>
<p>Second, those who disagree with his statements are less likely to identify with the headmaster, and, by extension, the school. This is problematic in two ways. First, it undermines respect for the institutions of the school - they are viewed not as neutral arbiters but as part of “the other side” - in this case, the “liberal” side. This is problematic in the same way as the rubbish collection example describes. Cooperation with school authorities is important in a number of respects - it helps to maintain safety, it qualitatively ameliorates learning, it results in smoother administration and reduces costs, and so on. The headmaster sacrifices this not only at his peril but at the school’s peril, for systemic harms like this will last after his departure. Second, it reduces the openness with which views are expressed. This is a somewhat independent harm. Views which aren’t heard are less likely to be held because probabilistically they are unlikely to be independently be developed; their lack of audience is orthogonal to their truth. This violates the second principle established in the first section of this essay.</p>
<p>Third, this harm is compounded by an innate adolescent contrarianism, and unjustifiably permits those who go against liberal orthodoxy to claim the intellectual high ground. That adolescent contrarianism is beyond the scope of this essay; assuming that it exists, heavy and burdensome imposition appears to be unhelpful in changing attitudes for the better. Moreover the headmaster’s insistent use of rhetoric, as opposed to analytic argument grounded in an instrumental rationality whose values can broadly be accepted by those whom he ought to seek to convince<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> allows his lack of analysis to be ridiculed as indicative of poor reasoning on the part of all those who seek to promote, for example, free trade, or socially liberal values.</p>
<h2 id="is-neutrality-possible">Is neutrality possible?</h2>
<p>In short, not particularly, but we have a workaround.</p>
<p>All statements either contain an implicit or explicit assumption as to what is important or admit their unimportance. Consider statements about fire alarms. This assumes that fire alarms are impossible (because fire alarms help to prevent death which is bad, and that death is bad is important).</p>
<p>Implicit assumptions as to what is important do not necessarily make a statement unimportant. We take lots of things as implicit; mathematicians take some very basic mathematics as implicit, eg. the law of identity, but we do not criticise them for that (much).</p>
<p>Given this, “neutral statements” also contain dialectic statements themselves as to what is important. These are in the same class as “ought” statements - “<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is important” can broadly be mapped to “one ought to prioritise <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>”, and “<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is more important than <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>” can be mapped to “one ought to prioritise <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> over <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>”.</p>
<p>Hence by default the principles stated at the beginning of this essay for non-established claims apply.</p>
<p>However, there are four exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>First, if everyone in a community agrees on a specific “is” or “ought” statement (eg. “education is utile”, “students will take GCSE examinations” and “water will be provided to students”), reminders, clarifications and so on are all permissible, without specific reference or resort in line with the principles enumerated earlier. This is because the implementation of a pre-agreed “is” or “ought” oughtn’t to require agreement again.</p>
<p>Second, we take assent without belief to constitute agreement. Attendance of this school is voluntary; the vast number of schools which exist and the lack of coercion on the part of the school mean that we can take the school to be engaged in an ordinary contractual interaction with parents and schoolchildren<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Hence that the ethos of the school involves the protection of the wellbeing of all students to some equal degree in outcome in all students means, for example, that even if one were to think otherwise<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and disagree the school may still act based on it, and so pronouncements in assembly, for example, about such matters are also permissible.</p>
<p>Third, what is trivially derived from anything in the former two also ought to be included as an exception. This is because parents accept that there is a degree of uncertainty as to the outcomes of a school’s axiology, as it were. They accept the school’s axiological premises, instead of particular outcomes.</p>
<p>Fourth, in a school environment, certain things are necessarily accepted as part of the former three exceptions. Schools accept mainstream academic thought in that they teach it. This is accepted by attendance. It is therefore permissible to, for example, take as established that there exists anthropogenic climate change, even if parents have not accepted this, by the second principle<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The former three exceptions can be applied to other institutions too. A rubbish collection company may promote respecting recycling sorting procedures without falling foul of the principles established before.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>First, we establish five principles which apply to the strength and presentation of dialectic compulsorily attended events. We also establish that the headmaster failed to meet four of the five principles at various times, and what he did failed to qualify for an opt-out as “established”. Second, we show that overtly dialectic compulsorily attended events cause three harms, the last of which is systemic. Given this systemic nature, two principles apply: first, that all alternatives should be maximally used, and second that if this is insufficient to avoid using publicly shared institutions, we should use extra caution, and so the smallest reasonably likely set of benefits should exceed the largest reasonably likely set of harms. Third and finally, we show that there are some opt-outs based on what is pre-agreed.</p>
<p>There is a broader problem here, which has not been identified so far. It relates not so much to the principles espoused here as the sense of entitlement which is felt by those who exploit common institutions in this way. It is shared by the proms conductor who felt that the beauty of Beethoven’s Ninth was insufficient as a plea for our common humanity and so his vastly inferior words had to compensate and those who thought his words appropriate and utile. Its manifestation is in the growing departure from any pretense of neutrality on the part of some of the institutions which need it most - schools and universities, the press and other common institutions. It is a complete ignoring of systemic considerations - a sand castle of an institution is one which is brittle, and when cracks start to appear, that a little water will appear to fix is no consolation, for the sand castle is doomed thence to fall.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>This is a somewhat confusing idea, which is difficult to define. Broadly speaking it includes what is either agreed with by everyone who is listening (eg. death is bad), is implicitly assented to even without actual agreement (eg. abbey service is compulsory) by some other action (eg. attending Westminster), is implied by anything which is already agreed upon (eg. that death is bad implies that Grenfell was a tragedy), or is the object of a broad scholarly consensus (eg. climate change is anthropogenic, Mathematics is true and Paris exists). An objection to the last statement was received in the writing process, so a modification to this is that this consensus can either be defined by the proportion of applicable persons who subscribe to a particular view, or in terms of the totality of the scholarly leanings of the community. The latter is to say that even if there is epistemic <em>doubt</em> as to whether Paris exists, few scholars (unless attempting something weird semantically) will deny that Paris exists, and will merely attempt to induce doubt. If we total the overall leanings of a community where some are uncertain and others are more certain, all in one direction, we can say that there is some sort of consensus there too. This term will continue to be used throughout this essay. An addendum is that some of what is established is accepted for differing reasons; deontologists and utilitarians both agree that for all actions <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> only causes a death, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is bad.</p>
<p>Although these may seem intuitively true, they will each in turn be justified in the second section. Some of the latter subsets of “established” truth are merely permissible because they form important subsets in turn of the first two.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn4"><p>The theme of the effect of authority is continued later, in “Neutrality: a desideratum?”.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>This is in reference to the is/ought distinction; see Hume’s <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em>, Book III, Part I, Section I, p. 469. Hume notes that we cannot determine what “ought” to be the case, ie. moral truth, without at least one other such truth; without any, we cannot say that anything is bad. An example may clarify: “<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s sole consequence is a death” does not imply that “<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is bad” unless we also accept the moral premise that “we oughtn’t to murder”, or “death is bad”. “Is” statements may imply “ought” statements in conjunction with other “ought” statements. Though this is the case, following Li’s model of “informed neutrality between reasonable ethical positions”, we can take some ought-conditions to be given (eg. death is bad), and so consider things which affect lots of people, and therefore may interact with ought-conditions, to be important as well, though they only describe what is.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>It appears that this also occurs with other speakers, eg. Bernie Sanders, as part of a weekly assembly. Liberty University is questionable in a number of ways but the imbalance in speakers appears to be caused by progressive speakers’ refusal to accept invitations to speak.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>The effect described here is plausibly more likely to occur when the group who disagree with a politicisation attempt have poorly justified views; poorly justified views are more likely to be grounded in some sort of blind faith, whether religiously or socially motivated, and so they are plausibly held with much more faith and strength than views which are based on other views and are somewhat instrumental. Contrast two opponents of euthanasia, the first of whom believes that it is biblically forbidden, the second likely to cause people to be forced into coercion. The former will be very hard to convince - biblical teachings are hard to rebut - compared to the latter, who may be convinced that this coercion is less important than the coercion experienced by those forced to live, or that it is very unlikely.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn10"><p>See other discussion related to the precautionary principle; the precautionary principle is a similar principle, where certain threats, although distant and somewhat unquantifiable, can be justified to restrict actions, due to their large magnitude. It applies to health and the environment, instead of a risk of abandonment of institutions.<a href="#fnref10">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>If he is not attempting to convince, he is merely virtue-signalling, which is clearly not worth our time.<a href="#fnref11">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Contrast, for example, the state, which may not do certain things due to its position as already here. Note further the inapplicability of a potential argument against claims reliant on choice: in an example where there are ten prisoners in a cell and one key, the ten prisoners are not said to be free even though they may be each individually able to escape, but the situation is disanalogous - there is no necessity that one joins the school, and there is sufficient liquidity experienced, at least by almost all those who go to this school, to say that this argument would not apply anyway because everyone within the school is able to choose somewhere else.<a href="#fnref12">↩</a></p></li>
