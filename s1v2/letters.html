<p>Letters do not necessarily reflect the views of <em>The Librarian</em>, the editor thereof, the Library Committee, the school, the library, the librarians or anyone else. Our present, tentative, policy is to publish all letters which are not defamatory and do not incite violence. We do not accept responsibility for the grammar, syntax and orthography of letter-writers; consequently, letters are published as they were sent.</p>

<p>While I was very much heartened to see the diæresis resurging in its usage, I remain disappointed by your use of the unclear annoyance that is the regrettably standard notation for the dental fricative, viz. "th", when one could use the neater symbols Eth ("ð") and Thorn ("þ"). You ought also to inspect possible alternatives to "sh", such as "š”, which are much more phonetic.</p>

<p>If one were to list all the ways in which the ‘Library News’ section falls short of the high standards that have come to be expected of the Librarian as a publication, that list could perhaps fill hundreds of your (magnificently typeset) pages. In short, the ‘Library News’ section is the most appallingly written nonsense I have had the misfortune to encounter. For the sake of the continued sanity (such as it is) of your readers, I humbly ask you remove the section as it currently stands and replace it either with accessibly recreational mathematics, or something written by someone literate.</p>
<p>I beg to remain yours, &amp;c.,</p>
